Progress so far:
- we are able to take in a graph, write a loop into every possible combination of edge (2^n) and then check if the subgraph is a subforest
- runtime is extremely slow because its O(2^n) * O(1)

What we want to do is to check for every cycle if there are any subforests 
- Might not be that much of a speedup 
- Count the number of sets that include one cycle, and more cycle, and do inclusion exclusion theorem
