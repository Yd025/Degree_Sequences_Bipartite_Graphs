# Meeting minutes for 2.11.26

The main thing is talking about the Havel Hakimi Theorem. What it talks about is that if we sorted the degree of all the nodes in the graph in decreasing order
$$
(d_1 \geq d_2 \geq \cdots \geq d_n)
$$
is graphic if and only if 
$$
(d_2 - 1, d_3 -1, \cdots , d_{d_1 + 1}-1, d_{d_1 + 2}, \cdots, d_n)
$$
is graphic. 

Our goal is to write this out in code using SageMath which is a Python package.

## Previously
We have been talking about biparte graphs and degree sequences. If there exists a cycle where an even number of edges and every other edge is connected between 2 nodes, then if we switch every edge within the cycle with every edge that is not connected, then we will obtain the same degree sequence.
